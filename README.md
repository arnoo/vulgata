Vulgata

=======

This is an attempt to build a beautiful version of the Clementine Vulgate for ebook readers.

The typesetting is based on the wonderful work of RaphaÃ«l Pinson with the Geneva Bible: https://github.com/raphink/geneve_1564

Tex files are based on (Jacques Peron's work)[https://gitlab.com/jperon/vulgata].
